This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to type mismatch during comparison. The `f` function intends to compare two values (`a` and `b`), but due to a type mismatch, the comparison may not produce the expected outcome.  The solution shows a more robust comparison method, checking types and converting to consistent data types if necessary.  The bug is highlighted in the comments within `bug.vbs`.
